                            <h4 class="text">Let's start with Jurassic. The reason why I chooce this is because when I
                                was still a little child I always loved to watch this movies. I always thought that even
                                tho some of the movies are quite old they ook visualy great. <br><br> I also always
                                loved dinosaurs. The thought that Miljons of yeurs ago they were wandering around the
                                earth is amazing to me. With the sciens where we are right now I also beleef that it
                                actualy is possible to have dinosaurs wondering the world again.</h4>

                            <h4 class="text">For the second one I Explane Loki. The reason why choose this is because I
                                like to watch Marvel movies. Most people then stat to like the heroes in the movies. But
                                from my oint of view I feel more story in Loki then n most other charcters. He has a
                                compicated and hard to understand story line. But if you understand where he came from
                                it is
                                not to hard to understand the way he acts. I can actualy understand the way he must feel
                                about everything that has ever happend to him. <br><br> So I actualy like the way they
                                give
                                Loki a story line that not all characters in the movies alreay have. He has a story whee
                                he
                                can progress in to the version of himself that he wants to be.</h4>

                                because X-Men was the first line I realy watched. I didn't just look at the movies if
                                hey were on tv but i actualy could watch them mulptipol times a day. Logan was the first
                                character I realy liked the story of. I always followed the new movies that would come
                                out and I alwas was analizing hat happend and with characters made a step forward in
                                there stoy line. I notices very soon that Logan has a very complicated story and that
                                you realy need to watch the movies more times to fully understand it. But even tho it is
                                hard to understand the true story I always like to try and understand it. I also feel a
                                conecton to this character. No mather what would come in to his way he always faced it
                                and got better from it. I could also realy understand his story very well. His character
                                realy grows true the moves and it is good to see that there is so much thought layed in
                                to the way the roll is played. <br><br> I realy like the way Hugh Jackman build up
                                Wolverine to be the character he is on this moment. And even tho the story is not
                                finished yet, you always hope for the next movie to lounge as soon as possible.</h4>
